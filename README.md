Introduction
------------

A CMS that's like no other. Generates static HTML files to serve quickly and efficiently.
With an administration area (that's right). It's also themeable.

**At under 10KB zipped, it doesn't need an explanation.**

Screenshot
----------

There's only one right now, but more are coming soon.
