Introduction
------------

A CMS that's like no other. Generates static HTML files to serve quickly and efficiently.
With an administration area (that's right). Oh, and it's also themeable.

**At just over 10KB zipped, it doesn't need an explanation.**

Installation
------------

Just get all the files, upload them, and password protect the `/backend` directory with `.htaccess` and `.htpasswd`.
No databases!

Start making pages by logging in to `/backend`.
