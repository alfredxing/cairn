Introduction
------------

A CMS that's like no other. Generates static HTML files to serve quickly and efficiently.
With an administration area (that's right). It's also themeable.

**At just over 10KB zipped, it doesn't need an explanation.**

Screenshot
----------

There's only one right now, but more are coming soon.

Just get all the files, upload them, and password protect the `/backend` directory with `.htaccess` and `.htpasswd`.
No databases!

Start making pages by logging in to `/backend`.
